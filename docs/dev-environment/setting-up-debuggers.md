# Server code

Feel free to add instructions for other editors/IDEs

## VS Code

Simply add the following `launch.json` file to your debugger config:

```json5
{
  // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
  // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
  // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/index.js",
      "sourceMaps": true,
      "outFiles": [
        "build/server.js",
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

And you should now be able to set all those lovely breakpoints and enjoy the luxury of the VS code debugger!
