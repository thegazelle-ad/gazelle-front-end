          <br />Quick tips<br />* *text* = italics<br />* **text** = bold<br />*
          &gt;text = block quote<br />* [text](URL) = links<br />*
          ![text](imageURL) = images<br />* ####text = subheading. The more #
          the smaller the heading.<br />* Embed video, just copy embed code from
          Vimeo/YouTube<br />* Hover over the Markdown text in the bottom left
          of the screen and clicking on it will bring up the list of standard
          commands

          Click on Articles<br />* Add staff(s), categories and make sure that
          there is a image URL and a teaser (these should come through from

        <p>
          <br />Trouble Shooting<br />* Click on RESTART SERVERS<br />* Refresh
          the page (and login again)<br />* Clear your cache<br />* Make sure

          uploaded both images<br />* Make sure every image starts with https://<br />*

        <p>
          <br />BIG NO NOS:<br />* Deleting a post in Ghost that was already
          published as an article and is assigned to an issue &mdash; this would
          crash the website by corrupting the database<br />* Publishing an
          issue with no articles in it or less than 4<br />* Unpublishing an
          article, in admin.thegazelle.org without removing it from the issue(s)
          it is in (this could potentially also crash the website by corrupting
          the database)
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />Good form:<br />* Unpublish articles that you removed from all
          issues (if they are published the URLs to them will still work, though
          it wouldn&rsquo;t crash the website, just direct URLs to them would
          still show up instead of our 404 Page Not Found)
