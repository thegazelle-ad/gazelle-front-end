# Documentation Index

The documentation consists of three parts:

1. [DevOps](./dev-ops): If you are not a lead engineer in charge of setting up the actual production servers you should never need to look at this. If you ever are in need of setting up the server, this is where you should look though.
2. [Dev Environment](./dev-environment): All the guides for setting up your dev environment. Both the crucial [Setting up your Dev Environment](./dev-environment/setting-up-dev-environment.md) guide, which everyone should check out, and more optional but helpful ones such as how to setup debuggers.
3. [Guides](./guides): Miscellaneous guides that are good to check out and at least be aware of what are in them. This is for example where we keep our guide for how to develop E2E tests for The Gazelle.
