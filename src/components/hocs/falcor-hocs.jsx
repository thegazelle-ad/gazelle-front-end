/**
 * This HOC factory allows you to provide data from falcor as props to your component.
 * This will automatically subscribe to changes from Falcor and provide updated data.
 * Remember it is a HOC factory so you have to provide it with the pathSets and possibly
 * the propMerger which returns the actual HOC that you wrap your component in.
 * @param {*} pathSets - This either takes a function which outputs the pathsets where the input
 * is the current props, or it takes hardcoded pathsets. In both cases the pathsets can either be
 * a single Falcor pathset, or an array of pathsets (which may possibly be a 3 level nested array)
 * @param {func} [propMerger] - This function takes the falcor response (which is of the structure
 * { json: objectWithPathSetsRequestedStructure }) and your current props as the arguments. The
 * output is going to be all the props your wrapped component will receive. The default simply places
 * the data in the props with names corresponding to the top level keys in the path sets.
 * see https://github.com/ratson/react-falcor/blob/0d2cefcbc71ca21465307182ec8495262e945362/src/components/falcorGet.js#L13-L22
 * for the default implementation
 * @returns {func} a HOC that can provide a component with the given pathSets to the specified props
